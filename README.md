## Purpose

The script emulates a physical Grid/Genset/AC Load Meter in Venus OS. It gets the MQTT data from a subscribed topic and publishes the information on the dbus as the service `com.victronenergy.grid.mqtt_grid`, `com.victronenergy.genset.mqtt_genset` or `com.victronenergy.acload.mqtt_acload` with the VRM instance `31`.

It also supports the Tasmota-SmartMeter format.


## Config

Copy or rename the `config.sample.ini` to `config.ini` in the `dbus-mqtt-grid` folder and change it as you need it.

### Home Assistant

This is only a simple example that can be reduced expanded to match the minimum or full requirements shown above.

```yml
alias: mqtt publish sensor grid power
description: ""
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: sensor.YOUR_GRID_POWER_ENTITY
condition: []
action:
  - service: mqtt.publish
    data_template:
      payload: |
        {
          "grid": {
            "power": {{ (states('sensor.YOUR_GRID_POWER_ENTITY') | float(0)) }},
            "L1": {
                "power": {{ (states('sensor.YOUR_GRID_L1_POWER_ENTITY') | float(0)) }}
            },
            "L2": {
                "power": {{ (states('sensor.YOUR_GRID_L2_POWER_ENTITY') | float(0)) }}
            },
            "L3": {
                "power": {{ (states('sensor.YOUR_GRID_L3_POWER_ENTITY') | float(0)) }}
            }
          }
        }
      topic: homeassistant/energy/grid
```

In the `config.ini` of `dbus-mqtt-grid` set the MQTT broker to the Home Assistant hostname/IP and the topic to the same as in your Home Assistant config (like above).

### ESPHome

If you have working setup with any esphome-p1reader fork e.g. [here](https://github.com/mp314/esphome-p1reader), you can add direct connection to Victorn MQTT server and bypass the HA instance.

Just add mqtt-broker, `id` -field to every sensor, and mqtt.publish_json to last sensor value (in my case "Cumulative Active Import", CRC ok event would be more correct place). See example below. 

```yml
mqtt:
  broker: !secret victron_mqtt

sensor:
  - platform: p1reader
    p1reader_id: p1reader_esp
    cumulative_active_import:
      name: "Cumulative Active Import"
      # id added
      id: E_in
      # on value update publish json. Uses id's are reference to other sensors.
      on_value:
        then:
          - mqtt.publish_json:
              topic: "han/p1reader"
              payload: |-
                root["grid"]["power"] = (id(P_in).state-id(P_out).state) * 1000;
                root["grid"]["energy_forward"] = id(E_in).state;
                root["grid"]["energy_reverse"] = id(E_out).state;
                root["grid"]["L1"]["power"] = (id(P1_in).state-id(P1_out).state) * 1000;
                root["grid"]["L2"]["power"] = (id(P2_in).state-id(P2_out).state) * 1000;
                root["grid"]["L3"]["power"] = (id(P3_in).state-id(P3_out).state) * 1000;
                root["grid"]["L1"]["voltage"] = id(U1).state;
                root["grid"]["L2"]["voltage"] = id(U2).state;
                root["grid"]["L3"]["voltage"] = id(U3).state;
                root["grid"]["L1"]["current"] = id(I1).state;
                root["grid"]["L2"]["current"] = id(I1).state;
                root["grid"]["L3"]["current"] = id(I3).state;

  - platform: p1reader
    p1reader_id: p1reader_esp
    cumulative_active_export:
      name: "Cumulative Active Export"
      # id added
      id: E_out
```

### Shelly (Gen 2+)

```json
 {
    "apower": 0.0,
    "voltage": 0.0,
    "freq": 0,
    "current": 0.000,
    "pf": 0,
    "aenergy": {
        "total": 0.000
    },
    "ret_aenergy": {
        "total": 0.000
    }
}
```

Ensure your Shelly device uses the same topic as configured in `config.ini`. Enable MQTT on your Shelly device and set the host, port, and topic correctly.


### Tasmota

Setting up tasmota as Tasmota-SmartMeter is not part of this documentation. See https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Smart-Meter-Interface/#meter-metrics
or https://homeitems.de/smartmeter-mit-tasmota-auslesen/# (German) for detailed information on how to set up Tasmota-EnergyMeter.

In order to get dbus-mqtt-grid working with the Tasmota-SmartMeter, the script on tasmota has to be configured in a specific way.

Depending on your individual Smart Meter, the first part of the script looks like this:
```
>D
>B
=>sensor53 r
>M 1
+1,3,s,0,9600,grid
```
Important for dbus-mqtt-grid is, that the `<jsonPrefix>` of the [meter definition](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Smart-Meter-Interface/#meter-definition) is called `grid`.

Following is an example of the [meter metrics](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Smart-Meter-Interface/#meter-metrics):
```
1,77070100100700ff@1,Current Consumption,W,power,16
1,77070100240700ff@1,Current Consumption P1,W,power_L1,16
1,77070100380700ff@1,Current Consumption P2,W,power_L2,16
1,770701004c0700ff@1,Current Consumption P3,W,power_L3,16
```

Important are the 2 last parts of each line.
- The last number (`16`) lets tasmota transmit this reading via mqtt immediately. This is necessary to get updates of the current power consumption as fast as possible.
- The second last entry needs to be named exactly like this: L1: `power_L1`, L2: `power_L2`, L3: `power_L3`, total grid power: `power`. These are the keywords that are expected by dbus-mqtt-grid.

The MQTT messages sent from tasmota should then look like this:
```
21:57:13.103 RSL: SENSOR = {"Time":"2023-11-22T21:57:13","grid":{"power":413}}
21:57:13.124 RSL: SENSOR = {"Time":"2023-11-22T21:57:13","grid":{"power_L1":94}}
```

Sending the total energy (kWh consumed and delivered) is also possible.
Since those values are not changing much, it is sufficient to transmit them only every [TelePeriod](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Commands/#teleperiod) seconds.
<br>Again, the important parts are the last two of each line, where `3` in this case means that you will get a precision of 3 digits (see  [meter metrics/precision](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Smart-Meter-Interface/#meter-metrics)).
```
1,77070100010800ff@1000,Total Consumed,KWh,energy_forward,3
1,77070100020800ff@1000,Total Delivered,KWh,energy_reverse,3
```

It is possible to directly use the ip address of your venusOS installation as MQTT host in tasmota.
For this to work, set the MQTT part of `config.ini` to `localhost` and enable the MQTT server on your venusOS: https://github.com/victronenergy/dbus-mqtt#set-up


The topic in tasmota has to fit together with the config.ini. For example:
```
Tasmota Topic: SML
Tasmota Full Topic: %topic%/
config.ini topic = SML/SENSOR
```

Additional information can be found in this [issue](https://github.com/mr-manuel/venus-os_dbus-mqtt-grid/issues/13#issue-2045377392).


## Install / Update

1. Login to your Venus OS device via SSH. See [Venus OS:Root Access](https://www.victronenergy.com/live/ccgx:root_access#root_access) for more details.

2. Execute this commands to download and copy the files:

    ```bash
    wget -O /tmp/download_dbus-mqtt-grid.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mr-manuel/venus-os_dbus-mqtt-grid/master/download.sh

    bash /tmp/download_dbus-mqtt-grid.sh
    ```

3. Select the version you want to install.

4. Press enter for a single instance. For multiple instances, enter a number and press enter.

    Example:

    - Pressing enter or entering `1` will install the driver to `/data/etc/dbus-mqtt-grid`.
    - Entering `2` will install the driver to `/data/etc/dbus-mqtt-grid-2`.

### Extra steps for your first installation

5. Edit the config file to fit your needs. The correct command for your installation is shown after the installation.

    - If you pressed enter or entered `1` during installation:
    ```bash
    nano /data/etc/dbus-mqtt-grid/config.ini
    ```

    - If you entered `2` during installation:
    ```bash
    nano /data/etc/dbus-mqtt-grid-2/config.ini
    ```

6. Install the driver as a service. The correct command for your installation is shown after the installation.

    - If you pressed enter or entered `1` during installation:
    ```bash
    bash /data/etc/dbus-mqtt-grid/install.sh
    ```

    - If you entered `2` during installation:
    ```bash
    bash /data/etc/dbus-mqtt-grid-2/install.sh
    ```

    The daemon-tools should start this service automatically within seconds.

## Uninstall

⚠️ If you have multiple instances, ensure you choose the correct one. For example:

- To uninstall the default instance:
    ```bash
    bash /data/etc/dbus-mqtt-grid/uninstall.sh
    ```

- To uninstall the second instance:
    ```bash
    bash /data/etc/dbus-mqtt-grid-2/uninstall.sh
    ```

## Restart

⚠️ If you have multiple instances, ensure you choose the correct one. For example:

- To restart the default instance:
    ```bash
    bash /data/etc/dbus-mqtt-grid/restart.sh
    ```

- To restart the second instance:
    ```bash
    bash /data/etc/dbus-mqtt-grid-2/restart.sh
    ```

## Debugging

⚠️ If you have multiple instances, ensure you choose the correct one.

- To check the logs of the default instance:
    ```bash
    tail -n 100 -F /data/log/dbus-mqtt-grid/current | tai64nlocal
    ```

- To check the logs of the second instance:
    ```bash
    tail -n 100 -F /data/log/dbus-mqtt-grid-2/current | tai64nlocal
    ```

The service status can be checked with svstat `svstat /service/dbus-mqtt-grid`

This will output somethink like `/service/dbus-mqtt-grid: up (pid 5845) 185 seconds`

If the seconds are under 5 then the service crashes and gets restarted all the time. If you do not see anything in the logs you can increase the log level in `/data/etc/dbus-mqtt-grid/dbus-mqtt-grid.py` by changing `level=logging.WARNING` to `level=logging.INFO` or `level=logging.DEBUG`

If the script stops with the message `dbus.exceptions.NameExistsException: Bus name already exists: com.victronenergy.grid.mqtt_grid"` it means that the service is still running or another service is using that bus name.

## Compatibility

This software supports the latest three stable versions of Venus OS. It may also work on older versions, but this is not guaranteed.
